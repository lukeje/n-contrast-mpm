# N-contrast MPM
This repository provides scripts for computing T1(=1/R1), PD and R2\* from multiparameter mapping (MPM) acquisitions where, unlike in the standard MPM protocol, data are collected with more than two flip angles.

Information on how to run the code can be found in the header of `mpm_Ncontrasts.m`

The code has not been heavily tested, so expect bugs!

## Requires
- SPM
- hMRI toolbox
- data to have already been registered and resliced to the same space

## References
